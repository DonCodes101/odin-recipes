            <p>REALLY EASY fruit collagen gummy recipe (under 10 minutes).</p> <p> This recipe is flexible in the sense of measurements and ingredients. Also, notably incredible for improving the structural integrity of our soft tissue</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Blueberries (3 cups)</li>
                <li>Beef gelatin</li>
                <li>Liquid: Ranging from Filtered water to Chamomile tea</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bloom 1/3 cup grass-fed gelatin with 1/2 cup liquid in a bowl and let it set for a couple minutes.</li>
                <li>Take blended fruit mixture (you can sweeten it with raw honey), and gently heat it up on very low. Warning: Boiling it will destroy the nutrients.</li>
                <li>Once it's warm, add your gelatin and stir until dissolved.</li>
                <li>Pour it into a mold or whatever you like, then refrigerate for approximately 3 hours.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use any seasonal and ripe fruits, as long as they don't contain bromelain.
                    (ie; pineapple, will break down the protein and won't congeal)</li>
                <li>You may also use fruit juice instead of real fruit, but fresh-squeeze it yourself to keep as many nutrients as possible.</li>
                <li>Depending on your preference/creativity, you can also add things like lemon zest, bee pollen, whole berries, cinnamon, etc in the gelatin mixture before it sets.</li>
            </ul>
